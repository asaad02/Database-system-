# actors
Takes a movie name as input (as the first command-line argument)
and lists all the actors in it. Each actor name should be printed as represented in the
name.basics.kv file, one per line.


# bacon1
Play the game, “one degree of Kevin Bacon”. This program will take one command-line
argument which is the name of an actor. It will print one movie that includes both the actor
named on the command line and Kevin Bacon. The program will print the title of the movie
followed by a single new-line and nothing else. You may assume that the actor name on the
command line has a Bacon number of 1.
